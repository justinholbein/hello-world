# hello-world
Initial GitHub Repository

Hi Everyone!

My name is Justin and I am currently learning Web Development. I love Javascript and plan on building websites, games,
and applications that don't suck. I enjoy learning about cryptocurrency and building applications on the decentralized web.
I am highly interested in Ethereum based tokens, smart contracts, Solidity and building web3 dapps.
